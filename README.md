# BreakGlass
Temporary GCP Privilege Escalation Tool

## What is this?

## How it works
1. Sign into the app with your GCP credentials
2. Select a client
3. Select a project
4. Select the permissions you need
5. Select a timeframe
6. Provide your reasoning for breaking the glass
7. Your permissions will be provided and the event will be logged
